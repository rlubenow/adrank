# AdRank

Ads quality, relevance, and ranking system with brand‑drift detection.

## Problem
Ad ecosystems suffer from brand drift and low‑quality placements that erode relevance and trust. Traditional ranking signals miss subtle shifts in brand alignment.

## Solution
AdRank extends Tim’s brand‑drift approach with attention‑based signals and multi‑factor ranking. The system blends relevance, safety, and drift detection to improve placements.

## Tech Stack
